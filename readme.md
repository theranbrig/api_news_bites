# News Bites

## Assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to use an API for the first time and display it on a page. I used the `fetch` method to make AJAX requests and built the site using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. I used [News API](https://newsapi.org) to get headlines from major news categories and the page can be updated and viewed easily. It was my first time using an API in conjunction with HTML. I plan on refactoring some of the code in the future, adding a search function, and making a few design tweeks along the way.
