## Assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to use an API for the first time and display it on a page. I used the `fetch` method to make AJAX requests and built the site using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It was my first time using an API in conjunction with HTML. I play on refactoring some of the code in the future, along with a few design tweeks along the way.
